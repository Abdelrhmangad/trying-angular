Keep in mind that as long as a computer allocates its resources to another device, it is already called a server."

Per Men’s Inquirer Snapchat Blogs, large social media companies like Snapchat use NAS in order to maintain user to user content submittal. NAS is usually used when one wants a quick way to add file storage."

   more_details: "You are already aware of what a server is and how it basically works, so it is just right that you know why servers are needed in the first place. A server is the one responsible for sending and receiving data files across the globe, may it be for a large party or rather private ones. Without servers, accessing information and going to websites on the internet would basically be not possible."
